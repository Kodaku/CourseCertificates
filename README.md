# Course Certificates
In this repository you can find all my certificates earned following courses on platforms like Udemy or Coursera.

All certificates are divided into folders whose name indicates the typology of the course followed.

# Important Note
The following courses are marked as completed but I just skip lessons because the course was covering aspects in an unclear way or simply they were not interesting to me:
1. Make a Fighting Game in Unity: from lesson 100 i skip all the lessons)
2. Apply Generative Adversarial Networks: the course was too advanced but also the last in the specialization so I copied the code of the exercises from a repository on GitHub
